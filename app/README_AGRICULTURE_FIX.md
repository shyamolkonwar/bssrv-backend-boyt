# Fixing BSc Agriculture Hallucination Issue

## Issue
The AI model is hallucinating information about BSc Agriculture programs at BSSRV University, despite these programs not being offered and not being in the knowledge base.

## Changes Made
1. Removed "Agriculture" from the departments list
2. Added explicit disclaimers that BSc Agriculture is not offered
3. Added stronger exclusion language at the beginning of the knowledge base file
4. Reindexed the knowledge base

## Additional Suggestions

### 1. Update System Messages in main.py
Find where the system message is defined in main.py and add explicit instructions about agriculture. Look for `system_message =` strings and add something like this to both streaming and non-streaming versions:

```python
system_message += """

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: BSSRV University DOES NOT offer ANY agriculture programs, BSc Agriculture, or agricultural sciences. If asked about agriculture programs, clearly state that BSSRV does not offer such programs and only offers B.Tech programs. DO NOT provide any information about how to apply for agricultural programs, as they DO NOT EXIST at BSSRV University.
"""
```

### 2. Implement a Hard Filter for Agriculture Queries
Add a pre-processing step for queries to detect and handle agriculture queries specifically:

```python
# Add this function to main.py
def is_agriculture_query(query: str) -> bool:
    """Check if a query is asking about agriculture programs"""
    query_lower = query.lower()
    agriculture_terms = [
        'agriculture', 'bsc agriculture', 'agri', 'farming', 'farm science',
        'agricultural', 'bsc agri', 'b.sc agriculture', 'b.sc. agriculture'
    ]
    return any(term in query_lower for term in agriculture_terms)

# Then modify your chat endpoint handlers to use it:
@app.post("/chat")
async def chat(request: ChatRequest):
    # Add this near the beginning of your function
    if is_agriculture_query(request.query):
        return {"response": "BSSRV University does not offer BSc Agriculture or any agriculture-related programs. The university only offers B.Tech programs in various engineering disciplines. For information about our B.Tech programs, please ask specifically about those."}
        
    # Rest of your function...
```

### 3. Restart the API Server
After making these changes, restart the API server for them to take effect.

### 4. Model Tuning
Consider fine-tuning your model to specifically avoid this hallucination, if you have that capability.

## Long-term Solutions
If these fixes don't completely resolve the issue, consider:

1. Using a model with better grounding/factuality capabilities
2. Adding even more explicit rules to the system message
3. Implementing post-processing filters to catch and correct responses related to agriculture
4. Moving to a tool calling or structured generation approach where the model must select from a list of valid programs

These steps should help prevent the model from generating fictional information about agriculture programs that don't exist at BSSRV University.
